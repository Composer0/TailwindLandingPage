# Tailwind Landing Page

https://composer0.github.io/TailwindLandingPage/


This was created as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. During the challenge I decided to employ the use of Tailwind to better understand how it could assist me and creating mockups of websites quickly. I took a few liberties with the visual look of the website and impleted a dark mode that is responsive to the user's device configuration. This functionality currently only works on a localhost at this time.
